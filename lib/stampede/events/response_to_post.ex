  The data type for choosing between possible responses to a message.

  A rough guide to confidence levels:
        0 -> "This message isn't meant for this module, I have no idea what to do with it"
        1 -> "I could give a generic reply if I have to, as a last resort"
        2 -> "I can give a slightly better than generic reply, if I have to. e.g. I realise this is a question
              but don't know what it's asking"
        3 -> "I can probably handle this message with ok results, but I'm a frivolous/joke module"
        4 ->
        5 -> "I can definitely handle this message with ok results, but probably other modules could too"
        6 -> "I can definitely handle this message with good results, but probably other modules could too"
        7 -> "This is a valid command specifically for this module, and the module is 'for fun' functionality"
        8 -> "This is a valid command specifically for this module, and the module is medium importance functionality"
        9 -> "This is a valid command specifically for this module, and the module is important functionality"
        10 -> "This is a valid command specifically for this module, and the module is critical functionality"
